# Data Structures & Algorithms Problems/Solutions and Notes

## **Arrays**
- A linear collection of memory locations, which each hold data/values.
- **Static Arrays**: An array that has a fixed amount of memory to store its data. 
- **Dynamic Arrays**: Implementation of array that doubles the amount of allocation of memory that is used to store data within an array in a fashion that allows the array to grow as more data needs to be stored.

### Operations/ Time Complexities

- **Access Value**: O(1)
- **Set Value**: O(1) 
- **Insert Value**:
    - At beginning of array: O(n)
    - At middle of array: O(n)
    - At end of array: O(n) for static arrays, amortized O(1) for dynamic arrays
- **Remove Value**:
    - At beginning of array: O(n)
    - At middle of array: O(n)
    - At end of array: O(1)
- **Copy Array**: O(n)
